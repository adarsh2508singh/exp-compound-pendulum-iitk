      "question": "2. What determines the time period of a compound pendulum?",

        "a": "Only the mass of the pendulum",

      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A simple pendulum consists of a mass (called the bob) attached to a string or rod of negligible mass, swinging about a pivot point. In the case of a compound pendulum, which is a more general term, any rigid body swinging about a fixed horizontal axis can be considered. Since a simple pendulum meets these criteria (it can be thought of as a compound pendulum with a very simple, uniform mass distribution), the statement is true.",
        "b": "This explanation is incorrect because a simple pendulum can be viewed as a specific instance of a compound pendulum with a mass concentrated at a single point and a massless string or rod. Therefore, the statement that all simple pendulums are compound pendulums is true."
